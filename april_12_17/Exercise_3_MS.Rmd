## Summary

<p align="justify">
Season 3, which was the most popular one, was also best rated by the audience. It was viewed by
`r df[3,8]` million viewers on average and was rated `r {df[3,9]}`. The series' popularity measured by the number of viewers and the ratings were tangibly correlated. After season 3, season 4 brought the most significant decline in absolute terms both in the rating and in the audience, which shrinked by `r abs(df[4,8]-df[3,8])` millions, reaching `r df[4,8]` M. The 5^th^ and last season to date, with the last episode aired on `r df[5,6]`, continued the negative trend: the series lost another `r abs(df[5,8]-df[4,8])` million viewers, reaching `r df[5,8]` M, and the average score was only `r df[5,9]`.

# Exercise 2

## Game of Thrones - Season `r params$season` summary in numbers

### __(*Warning:* spoilers ahead)__

## Overview

<p align="justify">
(From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones#Premise)) 
Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and 
D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels 
by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones'
Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble 
cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. A major arc concerns 
the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among 
the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. 
Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been 
exiled to Essos and is plotting a return to the throne. A third story arc follows the Night's 
Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from the North.
</p>

## Season `r params$season` summary

<p align="justify">
Season `r params$season` of Game of Thrones consisted of `r nrow(season_data)` episodes that 
aired between `r season_data$premiere_date[1]` and `r tail(season_data$premiere_date, 1)`, on 
HBO. The show gathered an average of `r round(mean(season_data$viewers), 2)` million first-day viewers
in the US, with the smallest number of `r min(season_data$viewers)` M viewers for 
*`r season_data[season_data$viewers==min(season_data$viewers), 'title']`* and the largest ber 
of `r max(season_data$viewers)` M viewers for 
*`r season_data[season_data$viewers==max(season_data$viewers), 'title']`*.
The first episode in the season, *`r season_data$title[1]`*, gathered 
`r season_data[1, 'viewers']` M audience, and the last one, *`r tail(season_data$title, 1)`*
- `r tail(season_data$viewers, 1)` M.
</p>

---

The most popular episode of the season was 
*`r season_data[season_data$viewers==max(season_data$viewers), 'title']`*, in which:
<p style="font-size:20px; background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 1.5em" align="justify">
`r season_data[season_data$viewers==max(season_data$viewers), 'description']`
</p>

## Here is how the viewership of the episodes changed:

```{r viewers-plot, fig.align = 'center'}

season_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(no_season), y = viewers)) +
  geom_line(color = 'darkred', size = 1.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:nrow(season_data), labels = 1:nrow(season_data)) +
  labs(title = '', x = 'Episode number', 
       y = '1<sup>st</sup> day TV viewers in the US (million)') +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_markdown()) 
```

## Finally, the episodes with the above-average viewership were: {.smaller}

```{r viewers-table}

season_data %>% 
  filter(viewers > mean(viewers)) %>% 
  select(c(no_season, title, directed_by, viewers)) %>% 
  rename(`No. in season` = no_season,
         Title = title,
         `Directed by` = directed_by,
         `No. of viewers (M)` = viewers) %>% 
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling(c('striped', 'hover'), full_width = FALSE)
```
